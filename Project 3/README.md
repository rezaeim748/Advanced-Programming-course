# Project Title: Plants vs Zombies

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the popular "Plants vs Zombies" game. The goal of the game is for the player to protect their home from waves of zombies by planting various plants that can either attack zombies or act as defensive barriers.

The game features multiple types of plants and zombies, each with distinct characteristics and abilities. The player needs to strategically plant different types of plants to stop zombies from reaching their home.

## Features Implemented

### Game Entities
- **Zombies**: There are several types of zombies with varying levels of health and speed. Some zombies wear protective gear, making them harder to defeat.
- **Plants**: The game features a variety of plants that can shoot projectiles at zombies or act as barriers. Each plant type costs a certain amount of sun points to plant.
- **Sun Points**: Players collect sun points to plant more plants. Sun points are generated by sunflowers or fall randomly from the sky.

### Game Modes
The game includes two difficulty modes:
- **Normal Mode**: Zombies move at a moderate speed and deal standard damage to plants.
- **Hard Mode**: Zombies move faster and deal more damage, making it more challenging for the player.

### Class Diagrams
The project includes several important design diagrams, which outline the architecture and interactions within the game:
